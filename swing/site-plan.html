      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>So here's an idea, could I create a language learning platform? Similar to Duolingo or Rosetta Stone, but instead I have a few different things added. Adding a few things, like the Leitner system of flashcard memorisation. Or perhaps where you can have easy access to the best learning language techniques, and the understanding that language acquisition doesn’t come super quick, and may well take years and years for mastery. So with an website, it would have all the pretty functionality, I would need a back end programme, I was thinking python maybe. It is what I’m learning after all. I don’t think it would be too difficult. I would like to work on this project.</p>

	The personal site plan I am going for is a language learning website, similar in a way to how Duolingo is but with some functions that I would really like to have in Duolingo but are not present. Doing a language learning website and application has also been one of the things that I have wanted to do for a while, but haven’t had the skills to do until this class. So two birds with one stone, not too bad in my opinion. Another main reason I want to do this is I want to see my growth with HTML CSS and also Python, then hopefully Javascript at some point, as I edit and revise my website and app respectively. 
      </h3>
The drive to come to this site rather than RosettaStone or Duolingo will have to be advertising and that we have a better methodology and tools to get the job done. Otherwise not doing those two crucial steps will likely result in failure. This will need to have better tools for learning to draw people in. Maybe one of the header tabs should be an advanced usage page, so as to not confuse people who are looking for a simple way. Simplicity is the key in 90% of circumstances. Since this is a language learning platform, I’m going to need to store data, emails, passwords, usernames. And then also have cookies. It seems most sites these days request cookies be enabled, I suppose that’s because they make their money on ads?

        This is where this following space image is supposed to be in the background, maybe perhaps a different one, more simplified perhaps, but this will suffice for the moment. This is also supposed to give you a breif overview of what the website/ company is designed to do, how it works, fairly short.
        Another thing I would like implemented more is more reading; specifically stories you already know. For instance, everyone knows the story of the Three Little Pigs, or Cinderella, however I have yet to see anything that combines these stories into a language learning platform. I originally had this idea while reading the Book of Mormon in Spanish, while I don’t yet understand it completely, I do know the stories and find joy in realising that some of the Spanish makes sense. The familiar story connection has been very helpful for me in that respect. 
        Another thing I would like to incorporate is AI. Not sure how to make one work, but I think it would be great if it could respond at different levels of speakers (or typers) and help them understand how grammar works. In this respect, it’s similar to how I understand children to learn how to speak. Slowly building on concepts they understand, to make a more fluid sounding sentence. Such as ‘You am very good’ to ‘You are very good.’ Or pronunciation, pronouncing ‘fish’ like ‘fis.’ This would be very interesting and in my opinion, useful to gauge your proficiency. 
        I would like a separate part for a culture learning section. Like how in Spain bullfighting is popular but elsewhere… Well I’ve never been to one. Or in England, where the American War of Independence is covered and the eventual changing of American British identity to a more fully American culture is covered. Not in depth by any means. Or for Chinese, and how gift giving works. Essentially for that you can’t give certain gifts because they can mean certain things, like gifting a clock means your time is running out, shoes you’re walking out of this relationship, et cetera et cetera.
        Speaking of proficiency I would like a semi-standardised test available -but not required, they can choose to take this if they want- to help them see what areas they may need to work on, such as speaking, reading, writing, grammar. That’s massively oversimplified, but that’s the essence right there.
        Expanding on functions I want that aren’t present, I would like to have a chart that shows what language family trees are, a short brief description of what they are, and then showing how to use it if you’re trying out learning a language food the first time, with recommendations on languages closer related, like German and English, vs. French and Cantonese. That may also have a separate search bar, where you input your language and the language you want to learn, where it could show a red, orange, yellow, green, blue text when you have either warnings on the difficulty of the languages you know to the other language you’re learning. Once again like Mandarin Chinese to Polish or another Indo-European language.
